# Automated Weather Data Ingestion with MongoDB

## Description
This project automatically fetches current weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API and stores it in a MongoDB database. It enables easy storage and retrieval of weather information for future analysis.

## Features
- Fetches live weather data periodically.
- Stores temperature, humidity, weather description, and timestamp.
- Uses MongoDB for flexible document storage.
- Simple Python script with minimal dependencies.

## Getting Started
1. Install MongoDB and start the server.
2. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
3. Install required Python libraries (`requests`, `pymongo`).
4. Update the script with your API key and MongoDB connection string.
5. Run the script to ingest data and store it in MongoDB.

## Usage
Execute the Python script to insert new weather records automatically. Use MongoDB Compass or shell to query and analyze stored data.
